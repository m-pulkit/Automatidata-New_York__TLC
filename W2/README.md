# Week 2: Exploratory Data Analysis


## Project Focus:
This week is dedicated to leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to organize and comprehend the TLC dataset. The goal is to practice and apply data analytic skills within the project context. The TLC dataset encompasses data from over 200,000 taxi and limousine licensees, representing approximately one million combined trips per day.


## Tasks:
1. **EDA and Cleaning:** Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the structure and quality of the data. Ensure data cleanliness by addressing any inconsistencies or inaccuracies.
2. **Select and Build Visualization(s):** Choose appropriate visualization techniques to represent insights effectively. Construct visualizations to convey patterns and trends within the dataset.
3. **Create Plots to Visualize Relationships:** Generate plots to illustrate relationships between pertinent variables. Identify correlations and trends that may inform further analysis. Additionally, utilize Tableau to create visualizations too.
4. **Share Results with the Automatidata Team:** Communicate findings and insights with the Automatidata team to foster collaboration and informed decision-making.


## Specific Project Deliverables:
1. **PACE Strategy Document:** Document questions, details, and action items for each stage of the project scenario in the PACE Strategy Document.
2. **Executive Summary:** Craft a summary of the results obtained from the EDA.


## Importance of This Week's Tasks:
Exploratory data analysis is pivotal in laying the foundation for further analysis and modeling. Utilizing visualizations ensures effective communication of insights to non-technical stakeholders, enabling better understanding and engagement with the data.
