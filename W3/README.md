# Week 3: Statistical Analysis


## Project Progress:
In the preceding weeks, I have completed a project proposal and utilized Python and Tableau for data exploration and visualization of the TLC dataset. As we move forward, the next step is to employ statistical methods to analyze and interpret the data.


## Tasks:
The following tasks are imperative at this stage of the project:
1. **Explore the Project Data:** Dive deeper into the dataset to gain a comprehensive understanding of its characteristics and patterns.
2. **Implement a Hypothesis Test:** Conduct hypothesis testing to derive meaningful insights from the data.
3. **Communicate Insights with Team Members and TLC Stakeholders:** Share findings and recommendations with both internal team members and external stakeholders from TLC.


## Problem:
This week involves conducting hypothesis testing on the TLC dataset. Specifically, I've been tasked with investigating the relationship between payment type and fare amount through an A/B test. The TLC client has requested a detailed statistical analysis of payment type, focusing on whether customers who use credit cards pay higher fare amounts than those who use cash.


## Specific Project Deliverables:
1. **PACE Strategy Document:** Document the plan, actions, and considerations for each stage of the project scenario in the PACE Strategy Document.
2. **Statistical Testing:** Conduct hypothesis testing to analyze the relationship between fare amount and payment type.
3. **Report Results in Executive Summary:** Summarize the findings from the statistical analysis in an executive summary, highlighting any statistically significant relationships and recommendations for further action.


## Importance of This Week's Tasks:
Statistical analysis allows us to derive actionable insights from the data, enabling informed decision-making. By examining the relationship between payment type and fare amount, we can provide valuable recommendations to TLC on strategies to encourage credit card payments and optimize revenue.
