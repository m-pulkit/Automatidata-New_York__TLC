# Week 1: Data Summary


## Project Background:
Automatidata is in the earliest stages of the TLC project. Previously, a project proposal was completed and approved by Supervisor Deshawn Washington. Access to TLC's data has been granted, marking the beginning of the data analysis phase. The key tasks for this week involve preparing the TLC dataset for exploratory data analysis (EDA).


## Tasks:
1. **Build a Dataframe for the TLC Dataset:** Organize the raw data into a structured dataframe format for analysis.
2. **Examine the Data Type of Each Column:** Check the data types of each column to ensure consistency and accuracy.
3. **Gather Descriptive Statistics:** Compute and analyze descriptive statistics to gain initial insights into the dataset.


## Specific Project Deliverables:
1. **PACE Strategy Document** 
2. **Executive Summary:** Important findings and insights from the data analysis in the form of an executive summary.


## Importance of This Week's Tasks:
This week marks the beginning of the data analysis phase, laying the foundation for further insights and model development. Organizing and analyzing the TLC dataset are crucial for the success of the project.
