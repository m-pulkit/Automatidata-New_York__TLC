# Week 4: Regression Model Building


## Project Progress:
The Automatidata team has made significant progress in the project for the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC). We have completed a project proposal, explored the data using Python, created data visualizations, conducted statistical testing, and now, we are tasked with building a regression model for ride fares based on various variables.


## Tasks:
1. **Determine the Correct Modeling Approach:** Decide on the appropriate modeling technique to build an effective regression model.
2. **Build a Regression Model:** Develop and implement a regression model using the chosen approach.
3. **Finish Checking Model Assumptions:** Ensure that all assumptions underlying the regression model are met.
4. **Evaluate the Model:** Assess the performance of the regression model and its ability to accurately predict ride fares.
5. **Interpret Model Results and Summarize Findings:** Analyze the results of the regression model and prepare a summary for stakeholders within TLC.


## Additional Info:
Our assignment for this week is to create and run a multiple linear regression (MLR) model to predict ride fares based on multiple variables. MLR is chosen as it provides the most accurate prediction by considering the interplay of various factors affecting ride fares.


## Specific Project Deliverables:
1. **PACE Strategy Document:** Document the strategy, actions, and considerations for each stage of the project scenario in the PACE Strategy Document.
2. **Build a Regression Model in Python:** Develop and implement the multiple linear regression model using Python.
3. **Report Results in Executive Summary:** Summarize the findings and insights from the regression model in an executive summary, tailored for stakeholders within TLC.


## Importance of This Week's Tasks:
Building a regression model allows us to predict ride fares accurately, providing valuable insights for TLC in optimizing pricing strategies and improving revenue. By interpreting and summarizing the model results effectively, we can ensure clear communication of findings to stakeholders, facilitating informed decision-making.
