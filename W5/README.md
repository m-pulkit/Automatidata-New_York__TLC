# Week 5: Random Forest Model for Tip Prediction


## Project Progress:
In the preceding weeks, we completed a project proposal, explored and analyzed the TLC dataset using Python, created data visualizations, conducted statistical tests, and built a multiple linear regression (MLR) model for fare prediction. Now, the focus shifts to identifying variables influencing rider gratuity to help improve driver satisfaction and increase gratuities.


## Tasks:
1. **Feature Engineering:** - Identify relevant variables influencing rider gratuity.
2. **Model Building:** Develop a random forest model to predict whether a rider will be a generous tipper (≥ 20%).
3. **Model Evaluation:** Assess the performance and accuracy of the random forest model.
4. **Summarize Findings:** Prepare a summary of findings for Automatidata and stakeholders at TLC, highlighting key insights and recommendations.


## Problem Statement:
The initial objective of predicting non-tippers was rejected due to ethical concerns regarding the unavailability of data for cash tippers. Therefore, the focus shifted to predicting "generous" tippers (those who tip ≥ 20%), aiming to balance the interests of taxi drivers and potential passengers.


## Importance of This Week's Tasks:
Building a random forest model to predict rider gratuity will provide valuable insights for TLC stakeholders to make informed decisions aimed at improving driver satisfaction and increasing gratuities. Effective communication of findings will facilitate collaboration and decision-making among all stakeholders involved.
