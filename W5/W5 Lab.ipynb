    "\n",
    "2.   What are the ethical implications of the model? What are the consequences of your model making errors?\n",
    "  *   What is the likely effect of the model when it predicts a false negative (i.e., when the model says a customer will give a tip, but they actually won't)?\\\n",
    "Ans. It will raise the expetations of the driver but lead to more dissapointment and frustation at the end of the ride for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "  *   What is the likely effect of the model when it predicts a false positive (i.e., when the model says a customer will not give a tip, but they actually will)?\\\n",
    "Ans. It might lead to the driver being rude to the custome and that actually might prevent them from giving a tip.\n",
    "  \n",
    "3.   Do the benefits of such a model outweigh the potential problems?\\\n",
    "Ans. It would not cause benifit if it has a low f1 score. Instead it could cause loss of tips.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.   Would you proceed with the request to build this model? Why or why not?\\\n",
    "Ans. Since it m=would lead to losses, it's better to change the objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.   Can the objective be modified to make it less problematic?\\\n",

    "Now fit the model to the training data. Note that, depending on how many options you include in your search grid and the number of cross-validation folds you select, this could take a very long time&mdash;even hours. If you use 4-fold validation and include only one possible value for each hyperparameter and grow 300 trees to full depth, it should take about 5 minutes. If you add another value for GridSearch to check for, say, `min_samples_split` (so all hyperparameters now have 1 value except for `min_samples_split`, which has 2 possibilities), it would double the time to ~10 minutes. Each additional parameter would approximately double the time. "

    "### **Task 4. Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, use the results of the models above to formulate a conclusion. Consider the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Would you recommend using this model? Why or why not?** \\\n",
    "Ans. Ideally this model should not be used as the metrics are low. It predicts a lot of false negatives ie the driver will think that a customer won't give generous tips but instead the customer would have given a generous tip. The driver might not even pick them up. But if the model says a customer will give a generous tip then its highly likely that they'll actually give a generous tip.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What was your model doing? Can you explain how it was making predictions?** \\\n",
    "Ans. It was learning how the model output is dependent on features and after learning, it predits based on its calculated weights for each input feature provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Are there new features that you can engineer that might improve model performance?** \\\n",
    "Ans. Yes features like (actual time taken / mean time for those location pairs), tax percentage in total amount, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What features would you want to have that would likely improve the performance of your model?** \\\n",
    "Ans. Features like behaviour of the driver, temperature inside the car, previous history of rider, etc."
