# Week 0: Project Proposal

## Overview
I act as the newest member of Automatidata’s data analytics team. 

Automatidata works with its clients to transform their unused and stored data into useful solutions, such as performance dashboards, customer-facing tools, strategic business insights, and more. They specialize in identifying a client’s business needs and utilizing their data to meet those business needs. 

The TLC has been collecting New York City- based data on taxi and rideshare trips for several years now. They've contracted our team to build a regression model that predicts taxi cab fares before each ride based on distance, time of day, and any additional variables we find necessary.
